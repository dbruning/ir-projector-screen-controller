# ir-projector-screen-controller
Raise / lower a motorised projector screen in response to the same IR commands used to power the projector on/off

#h1 Why?
My office does double-duty as a little home theatre room, and I've got a projector and a cheap motorised projector screen.
The projector screen is controlled via a RF remote, so I can't easily hook it up to the SimpleRemote iOS app that I use for other home automation.
So, this project uses an Arduino and an IR receiver, to look out for the IR commands to power on/off the projector and raise/lower the screen at the same time.
